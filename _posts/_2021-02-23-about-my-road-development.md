##### Development Environment



##### Source data
Source data is provided by government data sources of varying formats and structures. An ETL process was written for each data source to convert, clean and load the data. Data was then simplified and provided uniqueness then indexed both on search terms and geospatially.

A key requirement was ensuring ETL processes were automated and repeatable as the data will be updated at some point in time.
