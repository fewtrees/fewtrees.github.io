description: AboutMyRoad project overview

AboutMyRoad started with the idea that home movers when faced with moving to a new area are unable to easily and quickly understand what services and risks present themselves. This sentence defines what the products primary function is!

When you look at the issue in more detail, questions arise and more requirements reveal themselves.

Some examples were:

 * The consumer will see all locations of x and y at the same time.
 * The map will be returned within 200 milliseconds because it gives confidence to the user.
 * The UI can be used on any device.

Within a short period of time, the problem becomes non-trivial and delivery challenges demand a professional approach to organising work from architecture to stories, coding and testing to user acceptability and production release strategies.

My professional life has been focussed on technical delivery but this project involved a fuller commercial scope including:

 * Grant support from government business groups
 * UI design and sourcing designers
 * Social Media marketing strategies including external companies
 * Advertising production (artists, voice over)
 * Cost price analysis
 
 beside my traditional spheres of knowledge:

 * Story organisation
 * Technical asset delivery (architecture, tech stack, CI/CD, coding, testing)
 * User Testing
 * Deployment strategies
 * Production readyness

The project is interesting and I've enjoyed doing every part well (I hope). I've enjoyed the scope and appreciation of getting a product to market with many more considerations to understand. All in all I'd do it again.
