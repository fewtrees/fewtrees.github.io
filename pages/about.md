# Where it all began

When I was 7 I took apart my parents hi-fi system - I wanted the record player motor to use in a project of mine so went ahead and got the screwdrivers out. I even put the hi-fi back together without the motor otherwise I'd have some explaining to do. The lego windmill project was controlled by a Commodore Pet CBM using POKE commands to drive the vanes using the newly acquired motor. To me this was pretty cool and I showed my handiwork off to my Dad. He was seriously impressed as I could tell he'd no idea how to do this himself. Life was better until my Mum tried playing Barbara Streisand (Caravan) on the hi-fi when, it came to light where the motor had come from. I didn't sit down comfortably for a week.

Since then computers and tech has fascinated me. It was new, clever and I spent hours learning everything I could. At school the careers officer had nothing to do - I was going to work in IT. At college I helped run some of the lessons I was enrolled in (I still have the award) and in my spare time wrote software for a shipping company and my fathers company. At that time the software I wrote sustained our family.

For years I worked writing and supporting engineering software, learning the fundamentals (thank you Ray Barnes) and adjusting to commercial life. Since then I've worked on a contract basis because I wanted to keep moving forward. My lifecycle of implementing solutions was shorter than a companies product lifecycle which at that time was often years.

Today I still prefer being at the front edge of product development but take a more holistic view. It's because the role of IT within companies is expansive and underpins their existence. Information Technology is now existential to organisations and foundational to those which excel. 

This makes the IT revolution pretty exciting because it isn't over yet.
