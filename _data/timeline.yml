  description: I have taken a project with high churn, without working practices to a team with great ways of working and put development and tech delivery into the foundations of the roadmap. <br/><br/>
               I have improved BA deliverables that furnish agile lifecycles and Dev practices that improve quality. By identifying key issues undermining project delivery I have driven change across the team at all levels to a much improved and cohesive delivery stream. 
               I keep my hand in development and are comfortable mentoring and writing Java 11 code. 
               My other main contribution is through comprehensive and principled assistance to the team through exposure from the full SDLC within many industries providing guidance and mentorship wherever necessary. 
               <br/><br/>Finally, I contribute to SEGAS which is a Software Engineering guidance initiative across the HomeOffice for software design & coding and have published articles HomeOffice wide.

  description: From inception to delivery I poured heart and soul into <a target="_blank" href="https://aboutmyroad.com">AboutMyRoad</a> - a mobile application 
               that reveals ofsted, cqc, crime and flooding data amongst others from government sources.
               I've worn many hats on this project from designer, marketing manager, developer, dev-ops, sec-ops, test management, tester 
               and bank manager as this project has taught me hands-on experience of business scoped end-2-end delivery.
               <br/><br/>
               This system is delivered by a robust cloud based <a target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io">kubernetes</a> architecture with fully <a target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com">dockerised</a> deployments 
               and <a target="_blank" href="https://reactnative.dev">react-native</a> (javascript) providing a mobile application available on both iOS and Android.
               I have leveraged my pre-existing serverside knowledge with newly learnt front-end technologies to 
               create a robust, scaleable and secure system that is simple and engaging at the point of delivery.

  description: Vio were a small development team implementing the Open Banking API for the Co-Op Bank 
               so the bank maintained financial authority compliancy. Without this the bank is unable 
               to operate. I developed parts of the Open Banking API using Java 8 microservices running primarily 
               under JBoss but a <a target="_blank" href="https://spring.io">Spring Boot</a> version was also released. The API’s conform to the Open 
               Banking specification and follow the HATEOAS specification closely.

  description: The UK Blue Badge system was developed to provide a single service for local authorities 
               to administer Blue Badges and replace a multitude of regional legacy systems.
               <br/><br/>
               I managed a 5 strong development team implementing 
               the system from post-Alpha through go-live into the support phase. The system provides a public facing 
               web application for Blue Badge applications and a management web application for government local authorities both 
               delivered by Spring Boot microservices deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure.
               <br/><br/>
               Through wider project engagement I ensured the development team had processes, practices and product stories that 
               all delivered value. This Agile project demanded effective and continual collaboration with all 
               teams and contributed towards efficiently running project ceremonies such as planning meetings and 
               sprints. 
               <br/><br/>
               Secondarily I designed/documented microservice solutions and undertook coding stories. 
               AWS used extensively to provide storage, hosting and secrets management. Spring Boot integrated with 
               Redis for session management. SwaggerHub used to document APIs and the Government Digital Services 
               Toolkit used in front-end code. All code branch commits were unit and integration tested, peer reviewed 
               including quality metrics and scanned for security vulnerabilities including library dependencies.

  description: Developed a new seed information system delivering consumable seed data for 3rd parties and implemented a 
               multi-tiered micro-service solution providing REST API’s for both external websites
               and internal business systems. The APIs are secured using OAuth2 and Java Web Tokens (JWT) with a third-party provider. 
               <br/><br/>
               The project was created from scratch including building a <b>CI/CD</b> build pipeline using Git, Docker, 
               Jenkins and SonarQube. Jira supplemented Kanban and Scrum to organize the backlog, feed the Sprint and 
               organize the development process. I designed software architecture and implementation solutions, giving 
               guidance to external teams. Development work centered around framework components ensuring consistent 
               implementation and API development.

               mplemented as Spring Boot microservices, this cloud-based system utilised Couchbase clusters for a tokenstore. 
               Fewtrees has worked on several of their java backend systems providing fundamental business services i.e. store 
               front, checkout, product allocation, delivery & dispatch across various technologies including MS SQL & Apache 
               Camel ESB. I have also undertaken various front-end management tools using Angular 2 to manage and report on 
               shipment processing across all Hut Group sites. These tools are composed of REST based API's and SPA front-ends 
               tested using Karma and Jasmin. The development is TDD and work managed through Agile stories using Jira. On these 
               projects I've used many of the newer Java 1.8 features i.e. Lambdas, Streams & Parallelisation.

  description: Designed and wrote many parts of Stagecoach's new search & booking web application to provide travel services 
               across the US, Canada, UK and EU. The system achieves high availability hosted in a cloud environment 
               and supported Web, Kiosk & Mobile sales channels, delivering products to customers. Software written using 
               current Agile and TDD methodologies within a continuous build & integration (Jenkins & Gradle) environment. 
               The solutions included distributed gemfire caches, back-end messaging and SOAP endpoints. The software also 
               used Velocity for email generation and Motionpoint for email language translation. Custom AOP used extensively 
               for system performance monitoring. Deployment was Amazon Cloud with a cluster of Tomcat servers and MySql 
               databases. System management applications built using JSP’s, Spring MVC and JQuery. I migrated Stagecoach’s 
               live operational data using ETL tools and Groovy with 1hr customer downtime. In this position I also guided 
               more junior members of the team.
